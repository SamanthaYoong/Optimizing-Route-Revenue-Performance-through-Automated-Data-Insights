#  Case Study: Optimizing Route Revenue Performance through Automated Data Insights  

## ✈️ Context  
Airlines operate in highly competitive and dynamic markets where route profitability is influenced by multiple factors: **demand patterns, seasonality, competitor pricing, fuel costs, and macroeconomic conditions**.  

Traditional revenue management methods often rely on manual reporting and lagging indicators, limiting the speed and accuracy of decision-making.  

The challenge was to design a **data-driven framework** that ensures:  
- Reliable route performance insights  
- Automated reporting workflows  
- Scalable revenue optimization strategies across multiple markets

## 📌 Problem  
The revenue management team faced three major hurdles:  

1. **Data Quality & Access** – Route data was scattered across multiple systems (internal booking databases, partner APIs, spreadsheets), creating inefficiencies and errors.  
2. **Manual Reporting** – Analysts were spending significant time cleaning data and building static Excel reports, slowing decision-making.  
3. **Limited Innovation in Strategy** – Pricing and inventory decisions were mostly reactive, without testing new forecasting or segmentation models.

## 📌 Approach  

I implemented a **4-step framework** aligned with aviation revenue management practices:  

### 1. Data Acquisition & Management  
- Integrated **SQL pipelines** to pull booking data, competitor pricing (via external APIs), and flight schedule/operations data into a centralized database.  
- Designed a **relational schema** to enable route-level and market-level queries in seconds instead of hours.  

### 2. Data Preparation & Quality Assurance  
- Built automated **data validation checks** (duplicates, outliers, missing values) to ensure **99%+ accuracy** before analysis.  
- Documented data sources and cleaning logic for repeatability.  

### 3. Revenue Insights & Visualization  
- Applied **time-series analysis** to detect demand shifts and seasonality in passenger bookings.  
- Built **Tableau dashboards** displaying:  
  - Route profitability by segment (domestic vs international, short vs long-haul)  
  - Load factor & yield trends vs competitor benchmarks  
  - Forecast vs actual revenue variance  
- Automated delivery of weekly dashboards to Revenue, Sales, and Operations teams, cutting manual reporting time by **70%**.  

### 4. Revenue Management Innovation  
- Designed and tested an **A/B pricing experiment** on selected routes:  
  - **Control:** standard revenue management pricing  
  - **Test:** dynamic pricing adjusted daily using demand and competitor signals  
- Piloted a **customer segmentation model** (business vs leisure travelers) to optimize fare classes and upsell ancillary services (baggage, seat selection).

## 📌 Impact  

- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduced manual reporting time by **70%**, freeing analysts to focus on strategy.  
- **Revenue Lift**: Dynamic pricing test led to a **4–6% uplift in route revenue** without impacting load factor.  
- **Data Integrity**: Established a **single source of truth** with validated data accessible to cross-functional teams.  
- **Scalability**: Framework enabled quick onboarding of new routes, improving agility in competitive markets.
